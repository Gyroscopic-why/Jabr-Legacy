# Warning: I **REALLY** don't recommend using these versions

They are absolutely lost in time (including the source)

And the executables are **only stored for the update history (legacy)**

## **They will not be supported (updated), although they should _theoretically_ work**
But I don't recomend checking them out, they are like, really raw prototypes

Like, _why torture yourself with this_ when **I am nonstop working on the new Generations (esp. Gen 4 as of now)**

### **Not intended for anything but tests**
Like, **there are a lot of other good versions out there**

# **Don't waste your time with this one, unless you really want to :)**

### **Good luck (:**
