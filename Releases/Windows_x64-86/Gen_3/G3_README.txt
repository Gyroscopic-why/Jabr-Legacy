Yeah this is the newest versions as of october 25th 2024
There are 3 (2 and a half) different versions basically:
- v1.3 beta - the (almost final) prototype for v1.3
- v1.3C - finished v1.3 with additional dev info for debuging
- 1.3_Opti - an optimized version of the other 1.3:
      = Does not have unnecessary dev info everywhere
      = Runs faster
