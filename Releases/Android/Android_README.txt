Android release comming very soon, **est. date: 28 of April 2025**
Working very hard on it right now **:D**

You can see a _very small_ preview of the expected mobile UI of the program in the APK file next to the _README.txt_

It is powered by the C# dotnet MAUI (or renamed XAMARIN framework)

Plese acknowledge that the version shown is **nowhere near close to being finished,**
and _the UI will probably change a lot of times_ in the process

The buttons are currently dummies as of 9.3.2025 **(they do nothing)**
and don't serve any purposes other that UI demonstration

The Pre-release is meant for debugging/feedback purposes
If you have anything to say, write me an email at: **gyroscopic.why@gmail.com**
